                        <h1>Regulation of Neurotransmitters</h1>
                        <p>
                            Astrocytes are the regulators of neurotransmitters at neuronal synapses.
                            This is called the tripartite synapse, and it is fair to say that this is
                            <strong>the most important function</strong> of the astrocyte.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Cleaning Up</li>
                                <p>
                                    With transporter proteins, astrocytes clean up leftover neurotransmitters
                                    (like glutamate and ATP) after an electrical signal passes through the synapse.
                                    This prevents overexcited neurons (which are bad) so the synapse works properly.
                                </p>
                                <li>The Astrocyte Input</li>
                                <p>
                                    Astrocytes can also release neurotransmitters of their own into the synapse,
                                    which can drastically influence the receiving neuron's behaviour.

                        <h1>Responding to Injury</h1>
                        <p>
                            Through reactive astrogliosis, astrocytes are key to contain brain injuries.
                            <ul>
                                <li>What is it?</li>
                                <p>
                                    Reactive astrogliosis is a complex chain of actions that astrocytes undergo to form
                                    scars that isolate brain injuries. This includes changing which genes are expressed,
                                    cell swelling, and rapid astrocyte replication around the injury to form the scar.
                                </p>
                                <li>Neuroinflammation</li>
                                <p>
                                    Along with reactive astrogliosis, astrocytes release chemical signals called cytokines
                                    and chemokines that allow controlled inflammation. inflammation is good for healing
                                    but bad for function, so astrocytes also resolve inflammation once unnecessary.
                                </p>

                Being such an important part of the brain, a lot of research has gone into astrocytes recently!
                Here are some examples from major scientific journals.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50166-7"><em>Nature Communications</em> 15, 5979</a>, Braga et al. examine the role of the astrocyte in regulating the sleep/wake cycle.</li>
                <li>In <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07611-w"><em>Nature</em> 632, 139-146</a>, Theparambil et al. explain how the chemical adenosine, when picked up by astrocytes, is used to coordinate the energy usage, waste disposal, and function of the brain.</li>
                <li>In <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41393-024-00969-8"><em>Spinal Cord</em> 62, 133-142</a>, Alizadeh et al. conduct a meta-study of astrocyte research to determine that during spinal cord injury, astrocytes can be "reprogrammed" to act as neuron-like cells.</li>
                <li>And in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9873482/"><em>Science</em> 378</a>, Endo et al. explain some of the genes involved in the differentiation of astrocytes, and how some of them have turned out to be genes that cause Alzheimer's Disease.</li>
