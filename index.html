                        <h1>Regulation of Neurotransmitters</h1>
                        <p>
                            Astrocytes are the regulators of neurotransmitters at neuronal synapses.
                            <br>
                            This is called the tripartite synapse, and it is fair to say that this is
                            <br>
                            <strong>the most important function</strong> of the astrocyte.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Cleaning Up</li>
                                <p>
                                    With transporter proteins, astrocytes clean up leftover neurotransmitters
                                    <br>
                                    (like glutamate and ATP) after an electrical signal passes through the synapse.
                                    <br>
                                    This prevents overexcited neurons (which are bad) so the synapse works properly.
                                </p>
                                <li>The Astrocyte Input</li>
                                <p>
                                    Astrocytes can also release neurotransmitters of their own into the synapse,
                                    <br>
                                    which can drastically influence the receiving neuron's behaviour.
                                </p>
