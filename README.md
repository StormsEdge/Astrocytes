# Astrocytes
A website explaining the power of the Astrocyte. This project was created for
the Johns Hopkins University Summer at Hopkins Neurobiology course. Due to
time constraints, I was not able to make this project as good as
I had wanted to.

This site contains an introduction to astrocytes, a description of the different
types of astrocytes, a disscussion of the functions of astrocytes, and some
current research being done into this amazing type of cell.

This project uses copyrighted material by the principle of fair use. By this

Thank you to Aarnav Suwal (aarnav593) for adding the foot process note in the footer.
